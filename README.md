### LongQA & Generated Context Detection
This project is focused on leveraging transformer-based models to handle long question-answering tasks and detect generated contexts. The following are the key components and steps involved in the notebook:

Essential libraries and frameworks for this project include:
datasets: For loading and managing datasets.
torch: PyTorch framework for tensor operations and model training.
transformers: Hugging Face library for transformer models (e.g., BERT).
Other utilities from PyTorch and Transformers for data loading, tokenization, and training management.
Data Loading and Preparation

Loading Dataset: Use the load_dataset function from the datasets library to load the dataset.
Tokenization: Utilize AutoTokenizer from the transformers library to tokenize the input text for the transformer model.
Dataset Splitting: Split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets to ensure the model is evaluated properly.
Model Setup and Training

Model Selection: Initialize the model using AutoModelForQuestionAnswering or BertForQuestionAnswering.
Training Configuration:
Set up TrainingArguments to define parameters such as learning rate, batch size, number of epochs, and evaluation strategy.
Use Trainer from the transformers library to handle the training loop, evaluation, and optimization.
Optimizer and Scheduler: Configure the optimizer (e.g., AdamW) and learning rate scheduler (get_linear_schedule_with_warmup).
Training Process: Train the model using the prepared datasets, monitoring performance on the validation set.
Evaluation and Results

Model Evaluation: Use the evaluate method of the Trainer to assess the model's performance on the test set.
Result Analysis: Analyze metrics such as accuracy, F1 score, and loss to understand the model's effectiveness in handling long question-answering tasks and detecting generated contexts.
